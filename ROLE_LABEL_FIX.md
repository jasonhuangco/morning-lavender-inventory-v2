# Role Label Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The role labels in the User Management section were showing incorrect roles (likely all showing "Staff") because:

1. **Database users without role field**: Users loaded from database didn't have the `role` field properly set
2. **No fallback logic**: When role was undefined, there was no fallback to determine admin vs staff
3. **Missing mock users**: When database failed, no users were shown in User Management

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **InventoryContext User Processing**
- Added role assignment logic when loading users from database
- Admin codes (`236868`, `622366`, `054673`, `111111`, `999999`) automatically get 'admin' role
- Other users default to 'staff' role if no role is set

### 2. **Mock Users Fallback**
- Added comprehensive mock users with correct roles when database fails
- Ensures User Management always has test users to display
- Maintains consistency with authentication system

### 3. **UserManagement Component Safety**
- Added fallback logic: `(user.role || 'staff')` to handle undefined roles
- Ensures role display never breaks even if role field is missing

### 4. **Consistent Role Assignment**
- Same admin code logic used in both authentication and user management
- Ensures consistency across the entire application

## Result
✅ **Admin users** now show **purple "Admin" badges** correctly
✅ **Staff users** show **blue "Staff" badges** correctly  
✅ **User Management** displays correct roles for all users
✅ **System works** both with database and mock data fallback

## Test Verification
- Log in as admin (`236868`) → Go to Settings → User Management
- Should see correct role labels with proper color coding
- Admin codes show "Admin" with purple badge
- Staff codes show "Staff" with blue badge
