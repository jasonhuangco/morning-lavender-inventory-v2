# Order Logic Fix - August 1, 2025

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The order history was incorrectly displaying what was counted vs what was needed:
- **"Counted"** field was showing the quantity needed to order (incorrect)
- **"Need"** calculation was based on wrong values
- Database was storing quantity needed instead of quantity counted

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Database Changes (InventoryContext.tsx)
- **Before**: `quantity: item.minimum_threshold - item.current_quantity` (stored quantity needed)
- **After**: `quantity: item.current_quantity` (stores actual counted quantity)

### UI Changes (OrderHistoryPage.tsx)
- **Before**: Treated database `quantity` as "quantity ordered"
- **After**: Correctly interprets database `quantity` as "what was counted"
- **Calculation**: `Need = minimum_threshold - counted_quantity` (calculated in UI)

### Display Logic
- **"Counted: X"** - Shows the actual inventory count performed by user
- **"Need: Y"** - Shows how many more items are needed to reach minimum threshold
- **"Minimum: Z"** - Shows the minimum threshold for the product

## 🧪 Verification
- Created comprehensive test (`test-order-logic-fix.js`)
- Verified database stores counted quantities correctly
- Confirmed UI displays correct "Counted" and "Need" values
- Email notifications use correct terminology

## 📊 Example
If a product has:
- Minimum threshold: 10
- User counted: 8

**Before fix:**
- Database stored: 2 (quantity needed)
- UI showed: "Counted: 2" ❌ (incorrect)

**After fix:**
- Database stores: 8 (actual count)
- UI shows: "Counted: 8, Need: 2" ✅ (correct)

## 🎯 Impact
- Order history now accurately reflects what was actually counted during inventory
- Staff can see exactly what quantities were recorded
- "Need" calculation properly shows ordering requirements
- No breaking changes to existing data structure
